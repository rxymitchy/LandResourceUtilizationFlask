# Land Resource Utilization Assessment Tool

The Land Resource Utilization Assessment Tool is a web application that aims to assess the feasibility of further urban development in a specific area by analyzing critical factors such as population density, available housing units, and zoning type. The tool helps decision-makers determine whether the land in question has reached its development capacity or if there is room for additional construction while ensuring sustainable land use practices.

Introduction

This project leverages a Random Forest machine learning model to predict whether land in a specific area is available for development while considering maximum sustainable population density. The model is integrated into a Flask web application, allowing users to input relevant data for assessment.

Features

    Predicts land availability for development based on given parameters.
    Considers population density, available land, maximum sustainable density, and zoning type.
    Provides a user-friendly interface for input and result visualization.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    Flask (install using pip install Flask)
    scikit-learn (install using pip install scikit-learn)

Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/land-resource-utilization.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd land-resource-utilization

3. Install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

1. Run the Flask application:

    python app.py

2. Access the application through a web browser at http://localhost:5000.

 3. Enter the relevant data, including area ID, density, housing units, available land, maximum density, greenspace, and zoning type.

    Click "Predict" to see the assessment result.
